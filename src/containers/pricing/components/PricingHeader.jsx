        We don&#39;t like hourly billing and we&#39;re guessing you don&#39;t
        either. You have enough to worry about as an entrepreneur, so why add
        the worry of unpredictable legal bills? We only use upfront fixed fees
        and created a series of “bundles” for sets of popular and essential
        legal matters we commonly perform. If you’re interested in having more
        of a constant confidante than just a lawyer, we also offer on-demand
        general counsel work with our subscription pricing, so you don’t have to
        fear racking up expensive billable hours each month when asking
        questions and seeking guidance. Outlined below are some of our bundles
        with approximate prices. However, if you don’t see what you need (or
        aren’t even sure what you need), just contact us and we will work with
        you to provide guidance and a fair fixed fee.
