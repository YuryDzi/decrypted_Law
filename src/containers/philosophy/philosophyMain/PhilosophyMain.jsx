        <h1>This is Decrypted Legal &amp; Consulting (Decrypted for short)</h1>
        <h2>
          We founded Decrypted as a new type of legal services provider run by
          former “Big Law” attorneys who sensed there must be a better way to
          serve entrepreneurs.Our Approach Most entrepreneurs complain that
          contacting an attorney feels like an emergency room visit. That the
          services are ambiguous and confusing. That they struggle with knowing
          the risks or the benefits of preventative legal care until it is too
          late. While many attorneys typically over promise and under deliver,
          they still manage to drop off surprisingly high bills after each
          consultation or project. We designed Decrypted differently. Decrypted
          runs more like a business and less like a law firm. We are innovative
          and proactive. Our pricing is transparent. We provide subscription
          plans for those seeking ongoing legal guidance, without ongoing
          uncertainty about monthly cost. We use upfront fixed-fee pricing for
          your specific projects. We readily provide “bundles&quot; for many
          popular and standard services. We also use the same tools as you --
          Zoom, Dropbox, Asana, Slack, Calendly, Google Workspace, DocuSign,
          Stripe, and many more -- to make our communication and partnership as
          seamless and effective as possible. Although many attorneys focus on
          reasons why you can’t do something, we focus on finding innovative
          solutions and “yes if” answers to facilitate your ideas and ambitions.
          We don’t bury you in legalese. We tell you in plain English which
          risks are worth taking and which aren’t. We’re here to be your
          confidante and ally. To be someone who can help you navigate the legal
          landscape so that when you’re lost or unsure, we can guide you down
          the right path. Not someone you reluctantly call when you are out of
          options.
