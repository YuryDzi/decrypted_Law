            This is Decrypted Legal &amp; Consulting (Decrypted for short).
          </h1>
          <div className="inner-desc">
            <p>
              <br /> We
              founded Decrypted as a new type of legal services provider run by
              former “Big Law” attorneys who sensed there must be a better way
              to serve entrepreneurs.Our Approach Most entrepreneurs complain
              that contacting an attorney feels like an emergency room visit.
              That the services are ambiguous and confusing. That they struggle
              with knowing the risks or the benefits of preventative legal care
              until it is too late. <br /> <br /> While many attorneys typically over promise
              and under deliver, they still manage to drop off surprisingly high
              bills after each consultation or project. We designed Decrypted
              differently. Decrypted runs more like a business and less like a
              law firm. We are innovative and proactive. Our pricing is
              transparent. We provide subscription plans for those seeking
              ongoing legal guidance, without ongoing uncertainty about monthly
              cost. We use upfront fixed-fee pricing for your specific projects.
              We readily provide “bundles&quot; for many popular and standard
              services. We also use the same tools as you -- Zoom, Dropbox,
              Asana, Slack, Calendly, Google Workspace, DocuSign, Stripe, and
              many more -- to make our communication and partnership as seamless
              and effective as possible. <br /> <br /> Although many attorneys focus on
              reasons why you can’t do something, we focus on finding innovative
              solutions and “yes if” answers to facilitate your ideas and
              ambitions. We don’t bury you in legalese. We tell you in plain
              English which risks are worth taking and which aren’t. We’re here
              to be your confidante and ally. To be someone who can help you
              navigate the legal landscape so that when you’re lost or unsure,
              we can guide you down the right path. Not someone you reluctantly
              call when you are out of options.{' '}
